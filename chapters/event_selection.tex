\section{Event Selection}
\label{sec:selection}
The event selection is divided into sections, for events that have a boosted final state and events with a resolved final state.
The selection for each of these possible signal topologies are designed to be orthogonal and maximize total signal (resolved and boosted) over backgrounds as well as sideband creation. The selection criteria for the ee and $\mu\mu$ channels are identical except for the triggers.

\begin{description}
\item[Resolved signal region:] \
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{$ee$ channel:} $ee$ triggers from Section~\ref{sec:triggers}.
  \item \textbf{$\mu\mu$ channel:} $\mu\mu$ triggers from Section~\ref{sec:triggers}.
  \item leading tight lepton with $\pt > \SI{60}{\GeV}$
  \item subleading tight lepton with $\pt > \SI{53}{\GeV}$
  \item at least two AK4 jets with  $\pt > \SI{40}{\GeV}$
  \item all leptons and jets with $|\eta| < 2.4$
  \item di-lepton mass $m_{ll} > \SI{200} {\GeV}$: to suppress DY+jets contribution
  \item all objects $\Delta R > 0.4$ apart
  \item $M_{l l j j} > \SI{600}{\GeV}$
  \end{itemize}
\item[Boosted signal region:] \
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{$ee$ channel:} $ee$ triggers from Section~\ref{sec:triggers}.
  \item \textbf{$\mu\mu$ channel:} $\mu\mu$ triggers from Section~\ref{sec:triggers}.
  \item if 4 final state resolved objects found, then dR between the subleading muon and each AK4 jet $>0.4$: preserve orthogonality between boosted and resolved regions
  \item leading tight lepton with $\pt > \SI{60}{\GeV}$
  \item subleading loose lepton with $\pt >\SI{53}{\GeV}$
  \item at least one AK8 jet with  $\pt >\SI{200}{\GeV}$ \&\& $LSF > 0.7$ \&\& soft drop mass$ > \SI{40}{\GeV}$
  \item the subleading lepton must fall within the cone of the AK8 jet
  \item all leptons and jets with $|\eta| < 2.4$
  \item di-lepton mass $m_{ll} > \SI{200}{\GeV}$: to suppress DY+jets contribution
  \item $\Delta \phi > 2.0$ between selected jet and lead lepton
  \item $M_{l J} > \SI{600}{\GeV}$
  \end{itemize}
\item[Resolved flavor sideband:]\ \\  This is the control region used to estimate the \ttbar contribution.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item same as resolved $\mu\mu$ signal region but 1 leading electron and 1 subleading muon
  \end{itemize}
\item[Boosted flavor sideband:]\ \\  This is the control region used to estimate the \ttbar contribution.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{$ee$ channel} same as boosted $\mu\mu$ signal region but 1 leading muon and 1 secondary electron
  \item \textbf{$\mu\mu$ channel} same as boosted $ee$ signal region but 1 leading electron and 1 secondary muon
  \end{itemize}
\item[low $M_{ll}$ resolved control region:]\ \\ This is the control region to check the agreement between data and simulation on the DY contribution.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item same as resolved signal region, but
  \item di-lepton mass $m_{ll} < \SI{150}{\GeV}$
  \end{itemize}
\item[low $M_{ll}$ boosted control region:]\ \\ This is the control region to check the agreement between data and simulation on the DY contribution.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item same as boosted signal region, but
  \item di-lepton mass $m_{ll} < \SI{150}{\GeV}$
  \item no LSF requirement on AK8 jet
  \item no requirement that subleading lepton be contained within the AK8 jet
  \end{itemize}
\item[low $M_{lljj}$ resolved control region:]\ \\ This is the control region to check our ttbar background prediction for our resolved analysis and derive a systematic uncertainty
  \begin{itemize}
  \item same as resolved signal region, but $M_{l l j j} < \SI{600}{\GeV}$
  \end{itemize}
\item[low $M_{lJ}$ boosted control region:]\ \\This is the control region to check our ttbar background prediction for our boosted analysis and derive a systematic uncertainty

The reconstructed mass distributions of $W_{R}$ for the boosted and resolved signal regions is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:BoostedSR} and~\ref{fig:ResolvedSR}, respectively.

\subsection{Signal efficiencies}
The signal efficiencies at the signal regions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SigEff1}--\ref{fig:SigEff2},
as a function $m_{N}$, for each $m_{\WR}$.
