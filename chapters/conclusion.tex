\chapter{Conclusion and Discussion}
\label{ch:conclusion}
The most complete limits on the \WR decaying to two muons or two electrons were detailed in this analysis. No significant deviations from the Standard Model were observed in the combined \rootsthirteen dataset collected over 2016, 2017, and 2018 for a total of \GoodLumiNumber. The limit on the \WR mass is set at between 4800 and 5000 \GeV for \NR masses between 4800 and 100 \GeV.
