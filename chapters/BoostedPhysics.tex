\chapter{Boosted Physics as an Experimental Tool}
\label{ch:boost}

Higher and higher energies at hadron colliders increase the kinematic reach of particle physicists.  Events now collide at CERN with \rootsthirteen.  While this has been very successful in probing for higher mass particles predicted in many standard model extensions, searches for existing interactions, like \jpsi , are a challenge as it has too little invariant mass to be noticeable in \CMS.  The Higgs particle, with its leading decay to pairs of bottom quarks, poses another challenge, as its decay is typically overrun by background events at the \LHC.
